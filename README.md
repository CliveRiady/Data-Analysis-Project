# COVID Deaths Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing COVID deaths data using SQL and creating a dashboard in Tableau.

## Data Source

The COVID deaths data was obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## Data Extraction with SQL

I utilized SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to fetch the necessary data using SQL queries. The SQL scripts used for data extraction can be found in the [SQL](/sql) directory.

## Tableau Dashboard

I created a visualization dashboard using Tableau, which provides an interactive and insightful view of the COVID deaths data. The dashboard is available on Tableau Public.
